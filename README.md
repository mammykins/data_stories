# data_stories
A place to practice exploring and analysing [UCI machine learning data sets](https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.html)

## Objective
It is common practice during data science interviews to be given a data set to explore and tell a story about, usually within an hour. Here we explore different data sets to facilitate copying and pasting of code for typical graphical data exploration and data tidying at the start of a new data science story. The data are typically of three broad types or problems:

* Classification  - Pima Indians diabetes status
* Regression  
* Clustering  
* Time series
